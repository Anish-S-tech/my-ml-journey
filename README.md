# My Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my Machine Learning learning repository.

This repository documents my hands-on exploration of Machine Learning concepts, where I focus on building strong fundamentals by implementing algorithms from scratch and deeply understanding how they work internally.

---

## What This Repository Contains

- Concept-based Jupyter notebooks  
- From-scratch implementations of ML algorithms  
- Experiments on real-world datasets  
- Mathematical intuition behind models  
- Performance analysis and evaluation  

The primary goal is to move beyond using libraries as black boxes and truly understand the logic behind each algorithm.
